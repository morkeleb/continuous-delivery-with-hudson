  If set, and Hudson is set to poll for changes, Hudson will ignore any files and/or
  folders that are <b><i>not</i></b> in this list when determining if a build needs to be triggered.
  <p/>
  Each inclusion uses regular expression pattern matching, and must be separated by a new line.
  <p/>
  This is useful when you need to check out an entire resource for building, but only want to do
  the build when a subset has changed.
  <p/>
  <pre>
	/trunk/myapp/c/library1/.*
	/trunk/myapp/c/library2/.*
  </pre>
  If /trunk/myapp is checked out, the build will only occur when there are changes to
  either the c/library1 and c/library2 subtrees.
  <p/>
  If there are also excluded regions specified, then a file is not ignored when it is in
  the included list and <b><i>not</i></b> in the excluded list.
  <p/>
