    Different versions of Subversion clients store data differently in the <tt>.svn</tt> directories.
    This option controls which version of Subversion client Hudson emulates. Using an older version
    here allows you to manipulate workspace with your older command line Subversion clients, while using
    a newer version allows you to use more advanced features added to later versions of Subversion,
    such as <tt>svn:externals</tt> support to a file.
