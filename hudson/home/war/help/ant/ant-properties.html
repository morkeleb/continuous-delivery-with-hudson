<div>
  Properties needed by your ant build can be specified here (in standard <a
  href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.Reader%29"
  target="_new">properties file format</a>):
  <pre># comment
name1=value1
name2=$VAR2
</pre>
  These are passed to Ant like <tt>"-Dname1=value1 -Dname2=value2"</tt>.
  Always use <tt>$VAR</tt> style for parameter references (do not use %VAR% style,
  even when build runs on Windows).
  Backslashes are used for escaping, so use <tt>\\</tt> for a single backslash.
  Double quotes (") should be avoided, as ant on *nix wraps parameters in quotes
  quotes and runs them through <tt>eval</tt>, and Windows has its own issues
  with escaping.. in either case, use of quotes may result in build failure.
  To define an empty property, simply write <tt>varname=</tt>
