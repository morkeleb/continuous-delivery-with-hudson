  <p>
    Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building,
    a new build is scheduled for this project. This is convenient for running
    an extensive test after a build is complete, for example.

    This configuration is the opposite view of the "Build other projects" section
    in the "Post-build Actions". Updating one will change the other automatically.
