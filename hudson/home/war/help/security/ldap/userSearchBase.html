    One of the searches Hudson does on LDAP is to locate the user record given the user name.
    If you specify a relative DN (from the root DN) here, Hudson will further narrow down
    searches to the sub-tree.

    But in practice, LDAP servers maintain an extensive index over the data, so specifying
    this field is rarely necessary.

    <p>
    If you do specify this value, the field normally looks something like <tt>"ou=people"</tt>
