  Hudson understands the JUnit test report XML format (which is also used by TestNG).
  When this option is configured, Hudson can provide useful information about test results,
  such as historical test result trends, a web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures,
  and so on.

  <p>
  To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then
  specify the path to JUnit XML files in the
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant glob syntax</a>,
  such as <tt>**/build/test-reports/*.xml</tt>. Be sure not to include any non-report
  files into this pattern.

  <p>
  Once there are a few builds running with test results, you should start seeing
  something like <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/screenshots/5.png">this</a>.
