<div>
  If you use SCM polling to trigger a new build for a large number of projects,
  you may want to limit the number of concurrent polling activities to avoid
  overloading the server.

  <p>
  Setting a positive number sets the upper bound to the number of concurrent polling.
  Leaving the field empty will make it unbounded.
